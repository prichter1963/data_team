description = "Born in Belgium, from German/Dutch descent, Peter is a German citizen with a 25+ year background in Logistics & Supply Chain and in the last 10 years active in industrial development & construction, as well as decentralised energy. A networker by heart, Peter loves to connect people, be it professionally, as well as build personal connections without borders, nor cultural boundaries. With two kids, one cannot ignore the fact that the world is heading in the wrong direction, and it would be ignorant to claim that as an individual, one is not in the position to make a change. I am a global citizen, do not live in my own little world and wherever I lay my hat, that's my home, which for the past 24 years is Moscow, Russia."     "
